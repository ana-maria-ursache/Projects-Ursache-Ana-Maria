# 🌍 Country Search App 🌍
--> made by: Ursache Ana-Maria

##  Details about the project:
This project is made in approximately 2 weeks. It started from a simple idea: fetching data from a country. 

The initial idea grew more with each training we had, getting to this point: a small application that fetches data about a country, lets the user add it to favorite/traveled to categori and then export everything in a JSON format for future reference. 

All the functionalities and the design was thought having in mind the lighthouse report.

### Technologies used to make this project: 💻
--> JavaScript for writing the scripts

--> HTML(with semantic tags) & CSS(generated with SASS, using files with the extenion .scss) for making the design

### Functionalities: 💻
--> search a country name and see details about it(details: capital, region, subregion, google map, population, flag, etc...)

--> favorite a certain country you searched

--> select a country as one that you traveled to

--> change the color theme(2 available: light-theme, dark-theme, both with a pink tint)

--> export the data from the localStorage to be able to check it out later
